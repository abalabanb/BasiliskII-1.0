# BasiliskII 1.0

Date: October-23-2020

This is old version of Basilisk II, I know there are newer more update versions around on GITHUB.
This version focusses on AmigaOS4.1, so is designed around AmigaOS4.1 native graphic feature.

Please read the manual, if you like to mess around with thw configuration files, (you should not need to)

A few tips, if you using Fullscreen, make sure to enable "Screen Lock", if not basilisk II might crash, 
it used to be possible to write directly to screens bitmap, I’m not sure that’s possible anymore.

Best Regards
Kjetil Hvalstrand 
The maintainer of the AmigaOS4.1 build of Basilisk II.
